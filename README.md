#Use PPT to manage the papers  
We spend a lot time on reading papers when doing research. But it is useless if we can not find the right read paper quickly when we need it. I tried several ways to manage the read papers and found PPT is very efficient. It has the following benefits:  

PPT makes me happy. So I can keep thinking.   

I can search the target paper quickly from slides than from pure literal titles. 

The figure helps me recall the main message of a paper quickly.  

Enough space to add the notes and external links freely.  

Better interacting experience + easy to re-clustering the papers.
